# Signaltron
# 1.Tableau Project for Employee Expense Management
## Background:
Signaltron, a telecommunication-based company, faced challenges in managing employee expenses, particularly during Enode B deployment, leading to significant cost escalations.

## Solution Proposal:
Recognizing the need for improvement, I initiated a project to develop a Tableau dashboard dedicated to tracking employee expenses and conducting operational analysis related to Enode B deployment.

## Key Contributions:

Identifying Opportunities: I identified the need to enhance inventory management alongside expense tracking to achieve comprehensive cost and time reductions.
Collaborative Approach: I collaborated with relevant teams to gather data and insights for dashboard development and inventory management strategies.
Expense Tracking: The Tableau dashboard facilitated real-time expense tracking and resource allocation optimization, resulting in reduced time taken for discussion by 10%.
Inventory Management: Implemented strategies focused on optimizing stock levels, reducing excess inventory, and enhancing inventory turnover rates.
Integrated Approach: By integrating inventory management practices with expense management, we achieved additional cost and time reductions beyond the initial improvements.
## Results:
Comprehensive data gathering and rigorous data cleaning processes ensured accuracy in expense and inventory management.
The integrated approach led to significant cost and time reductions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Tableau dashboard and inventory management strategies.

# 2.Automated Board Testing Systems
## Challenge Identified:
Manual board testing processes for power supply and surge protection were time-consuming (around 20 minutes per test) and error-prone.

## Solution Development:
Taking initiative, I proposed and developed an automated board testing system using Python, pyVisa, and pandas to address efficiency and accuracy issues.

## Approach:

Analysis and Planning: Conducted a thorough analysis of existing testing procedures to identify automation opportunities.
Technical Expertise: Leveraged Python programming skills, pyVisa for instrument communication, and pandas for data manipulation to design and implement the automated testing framework.
Implementation: The automated system reduced processing time per test from 20 minutes to just 1 minute, significantly improving efficiency and minimizing errors.
## Impact:
Remarkable reduction in testing time saved valuable resources and enhanced testing accuracy.
The automated system mitigated risks associated with manual testing, ensuring reliability in board testing processes.
